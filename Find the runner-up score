PROBLEM STATEMENT :


Given the participants's score sheet for your University Sports Day, you are required to find the runner-up score. 
You are given scores. Store them in a list and find the score of the runner-up.

Note : This is in reference to Python 3
Input Format :

The first line contains n. The second line contains an array A[] of n integers each separated by a space.

Constraints :

2 <= n <= 10
-100 <= A[i] <= 100

Output Format n :

Print the runner-up score.

Sample Input

5
2 3 6 6 5

Sample Output

5

SOLUTION :
1st line: n = int(input()) 
          This takes input from command line. 
          Please note that input type is going to be in string format and we have to use int() to convert from string to int

2nd line: arr = map(int, input().split()) 
          Now, we are are mapping input(text) to int.

3rd line: arr = list(set(list(arr))) 
          here we are convert array to list and getting its set and then converting to list.

Others: We are sorting the list by using sorted and getting second last element.

    arr = list(set(list(arr)))
    ar = len(arr)
    arr = sorted(arr)
